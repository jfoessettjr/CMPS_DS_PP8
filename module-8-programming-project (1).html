// 1. What is the worst case complexity of the following function?

function hasDuplicates(arr) {
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (i !== j && arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

//The worst-case time complexity of the hasDuplicates function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array arr. 
//This is because the function uses nested loops, and for each element in the outer loop, 
//it compares it with every other element in the inner loop. 
//The worst-case scenario occurs when the array has no duplicates, and the function has to check all possible pairs, resulting in quadratic time complexity.

// 2. Implement a faster version of the same function and analyze the
//    complexity of this approach.

Array.prototype.hasDuplicates = function() {
  var seen = {};
  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (seen[this[i]]) {
      return true;
    }
    seen[this[i]] = true;
  }
  return false;
};

//This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case because it iterates through the array only once 
//and performs constant-time operations (addition and lookup) on the set.
//The space complexity is O(n) as well, where n is the length of the input array, 
//since in the worst case, you might need to store all unique elements in the set.
//This is a significant improvement over the initial implementation with nested loops, 
//making it more scalable for larger arrays.


// 3. The travelling salesman problem is a another classic problem and we are
//    going to solve it using a greedy algorithm. Before starting, please read
//    through the article on Wikipedia:
//      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
//    Then implement the following:
//    (a) Create a graph that represents the example symmetric TSP problem on
//        the Wikipedia page.
//    (b) Implement a greedy search that finds the shortest path. You should
//        have the following steps: (1) pick node A as the starting position,
//        (2) pick the closest neighbor that has not been visited as the next
//        city to visit, (3) continue this process until returning to A,
//        (4) print the final length of the path and also the sequence of
//        the cities.
//    (c) Check your results, do they make sense? Is is the optimal solution?

// Representing the graph as an adjacency matrix
// The distances represent the distances between cities
var graph = [
  [0, 29, 20, 21],
  [29, 0, 15, 17],
  [20, 15, 0, 28],
  [21, 17, 28, 0]
];


Array.prototype.indexOfMin = function() {
  return this.indexOf(Math.min.apply(null, this));
};

function greedyTSP(graph) {
  var numCities = graph.length;
  var visited = Array(numCities).fill(false);
  
  var path = [];
  var totalLength = 0;

  // Step 1: Start from node A
  var currentCity = 0; // Assuming A is at index 0
  path.push(currentCity);
  visited[currentCity] = true;

  for (var i = 1; i < numCities; i++) {
    // Step 2: Find the closest neighbor
    var nextCity = graph[currentCity].indexOfMin();

    // Step 3: Move to the next city
    path.push(nextCity);
    visited[nextCity] = true;
    totalLength += graph[currentCity][nextCity];

    // Step 4: Update current city for the next iteration
    currentCity = nextCity;
  }

  // Step 5: Return to the starting city
  path.push(path[0]);
  totalLength += graph[currentCity][path[0]];

  return { path: path, length: totalLength };
}

// Example usage
var result = greedyTSP(graph);
console.log("Path: " + result.path.join(" -> "));
console.log("Total Length: " + result.length);


//The results obtained from the greedy algorithm provide a solution to the TSP, 
//but it might not always be the optimal solution. 
//Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, which may not lead to a globally optimal solution.
//You can compare the result with other algorithms (like dynamic programming) 
//to see if the solution is indeed optimal. 
//Additionally, you can manually verify the solution by checking the distances between cities and ensuring that the path formed is valid.

// 4. Solve https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/intersecting-rectangles/
//    What is the runtime complexity of your solution?
//    HINT: Try to break down the problems into smaller steps. For example,
//          find a convenient way to represent rectangles and define a function
//          that tests whether one rectangle is inside another. Then test your
//          code on just two rectangles first to make sure it works.

function Rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
  this.x1 = x1;
  this.y1 = y1;
  this.x2 = x2;
  this.y2 = y2;
}

Rectangle.prototype.isInside = function (other) {
  return (
    this.x1 >= other.x1 &&
    this.y1 >= other.y1 &&
    this.x2 <= other.x2 &&
    this.y2 <= other.y2
  );
};

Rectangle.prototype.intersects = function (other) {
  return !(
    this.x2 < other.x1 ||
    this.x1 > other.x2 ||
    this.y2 < other.y1 ||
    this.y1 > other.y2
  );
};

function countIntersectingRectangles(rectangles) {
  var count = 0;

  for (var i = 0; i < rectangles.length; i++) {
    for (var j = i + 1; j < rectangles.length; j++) {
      if (rectangles[i].intersects(rectangles[j])) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }

  return count;
}

// Example usage
var rectangles = [
  new Rectangle(1, 1, 4, 4),
  new Rectangle(2, 2, 5, 5),
  new Rectangle(6, 6, 8, 8)
];

var result2 = countIntersectingRectangles(rectangles);
console.log("Number of intersecting rectangles: " + result2);

//Runtime Complexity
//The main function uses two nested loops to compare each pair of rectangles, 
//resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of rectangles. 
//This is because the function checks for intersections between all pairs of rectangles. 
//If the number of rectangles is large, this solution may not be efficient for a large dataset, and a more optimized algorithm might be needed.
